# 🎨 Screen Canvas

## 🌟 Why Use This?

Most operating systems don't have a simple "Turn Screen Off" button that keeps background tasks running. Closing the lid can cause overheating.

**Screen Canvas** solves this by running a full-screen web page that:
1.  **Prevents Burn-in:** Default blackout mode.
2.  **Saves Power:** Reduces light output on OLED screens.
3.  **Communicates:** Acts as a digital sign when you step away (e.g., "Back at 2 PM").

## 🛠️ Features

### 1. Instant Blackout (Default)

### 2. Digital Billboard
Need to leave a message?
- **Custom Text:** Supports Markdown formatting (Bold, Italic, Headers).
- **Auto-Resizing:** Text automatically scales to fill the screen perfectly.
- **Custom Colors:** Change background and text colors to suit your needs (e.g., Red background for "Do Not Disturb").

### 3. Smart UI
- **Auto-Hide:** Controls disappear automatically when idle.
